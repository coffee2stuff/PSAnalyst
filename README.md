# PSAnalyst Web

PSAnalyst is a personality analysis tool that enables you to gain personality insights into your writing using IBM Watson, a state-of-the-art collection of AI tools ranging from image recognition, speech-to-text, to natural language processing.

This is a React-based web version of the application developed in TypeScript.

The application allows user to upload a text file below, which will be sent for processing. A meaningful personality profile can be created only where sufficient data of suitable quantity and quality is provided. Because language use varies naturally from document to document and from time to time, a small sample of text might not be representative of an individual's overall language patterns. You are limited with 20 MB of input content. Typically, the best results come at around 3000 words of input, and more content does not contribute to the accuracy of the profile. Ideally you would therefore want to send a sample text, such as your motivational letter, or any sort of a document indicative of your personal writing style, for further analysis.
